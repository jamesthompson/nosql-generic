# NoSQL Generic

Haskell generic (de)serialization typeclass derivation for popular NoSQL databases for record types, making use of **GHC.Generics**.

*n.b.* This is a WIP! Presently targeting GHC 7.10.3.

- First effort will be for Gogol Datastore, then I intend to work on Amazonka's DynamoDB data serialization.
